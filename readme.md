# Natours Application

Built using modern technologies: node.js, express, mongoDB, mongoose.
Fundamentals of Node.js, core modules, and NPM (Node Package Manager) are used.
There has been special emphasis given on how Node.js works behind the scenes: event loop, blocking vs non-blocking code, event-driven architecture, streams, modules, etc.

**Here are a few of technologies used in the above natours application:

1>Fundamentals of Express (Node.js framework): routing, middleware, sending responses, etc. are used.

2>RESTful API design and development with advanced features: filtering, sorting, aliasing, pagination.

3>Server-side website rendering (HTML) with Pug templates

4>CRUD operations with MongoDB database locally and on the Atlas platform (in the cloud)

5>Advanced MongoDB: geospatial queries, aggregation pipeline, and operators

6>Fundamentals of Mongoose (MongoDB JS driver): Data models, CRUD operations, data validation, and middleware
